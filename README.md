# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

This project fulfils the criteria of a marketing agency who want their codebase to follow accessibility standards in order to optimise their site for search engines.

The codebase has been refactored throughout, including the replacement of non-semantic HTML elements with their semantic equivalents, the consolidation of CSS (where applicable) and the addition of alt attributes to all images / icons.
